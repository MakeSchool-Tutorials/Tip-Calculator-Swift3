Congratulations! You just built a fully functioning iOS app!

Had an issue at some point? Just want to see the solution? [Download it here!] (https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Tip-Calculator-Swift3-Solution/archive/master.zip)

Throughout this tutorial you learned a lot about how to use Xcode including:

* Adding elements to Storyboards
* Connecting elements to your code
* Using auto-layout to position elements on the screen
* Adding color and images to your app
* Using scaled resources


# Ready for a challenge?

> If you're looking for something to really test you, here's some optional challenges that were thought up by our instructors!
>
> Don't worry too much about these, but feel free to take them as a chance to think about how you might solve an interesting problem!

1. Assets, like the ones you used for this section, are files such as images, videos, and sound clips that are used within an app. Can you think of a good example of assets used in apps you have on your phone?
1. We discussed how to import assets into your app. Can you think of any reasons why someone would want to get assets into their app by some other means, for example, how does your profile picture for facebook get into the app? What about your videos on instagram?
1. You learned how to change the color of an element. Colors and the ones you use are VERY important. Designers will spend their entire careers studying color theory, and colors are such a powerful part of a brand that they can even be Trademarked! At the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, they've trademarked the color of the "RIT Brick" that makes up a massive part of their campus! Think carefully about what colors you choose to use for your app, and don't forget to look at what other apps are using for their colors.
1. We changed the keyboard that is used in the bill amount field to be a number pad. Subtle changes like this are never apparent until you encounter a truly awful app that does not include them. Take a moment to look at the other keyboard choices, and think about when you might want to use them.

> Wow, now things are looking pretty professional. Nice work for your first app!

Time to move on to a more advanced app, Make School Notes!
